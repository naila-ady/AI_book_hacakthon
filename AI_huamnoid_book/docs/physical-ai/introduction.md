# Introduction to Physical AI

This chapter introduces the fundamental concepts of Physical AI, exploring its definition, historical context, and current applications.

## What is Physical AI?

Physical AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that interact with the physical world through sensors and actuators. Unlike purely software-based AI, physical AI embodies intelligence in a physical form, allowing it to perceive, reason, and act within real-world environments.

## Key Components

Physical AI systems typically comprise:

- **Sensors**: For perceiving the environment (e.g., cameras, microphones, touch sensors).
- **Actuators**: For taking physical action (e.g., motors, grippers, speakers).
- **Control Systems**: Software and hardware that process sensor data, make decisions, and command actuators.
- **Learning Algorithms**: To adapt and improve performance over time through experience.

## Applications

Examples of Physical AI include:

- **Robotics**: Industrial robots, service robots, humanoid robots.
- **Autonomous Vehicles**: Self-driving cars, drones.
- **Smart Manufacturing**: Automated assembly lines, quality control systems.
