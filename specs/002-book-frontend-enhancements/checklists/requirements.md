# Specification Quality Checklist: Frontend Enhancements
      
**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-08
**Feature**: [./spec.md]
      
## Content Quality
      
- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed
      
## Requirement Completeness
      
- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [ ] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified
      
## Feature Readiness
      
- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification
      
## Notes
      
- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/sp.clarify` or `/sp.plan`
- **Edge cases identified**: The spec does not explicitly identify edge cases. This should be considered for future iterations, especially for error handling and unexpected user inputs.
