# Documentation Content Update Specification

## Overview
This specification documents the addition of comprehensive content to chapters 5-8 in the Physical AI section of the AI Robotics Book documentation.

## Problem Statement
The Physical AI section of the documentation had placeholder content for chapters 5-8, with only "[NEEDS CONTENT]" placeholders instead of actual educational content.

## Solution
Created comprehensive, educational content for chapters 5-8 in the Physical AI section, each within 80 lines of text to maintain consistency and readability.

## Chapters Updated

### Chapter 5: Embodied AI and Learning
- **File**: `frontend/docs/3-physical-ai/chapter-5-embodied-ai-and-learning.md`
- **Content**: Covers embodied AI concepts, sensorimotor integration, reinforcement learning in physical systems, active learning strategies, transfer learning, and future directions.

### Chapter 6: Real-World Applications of Physical AI
- **File**: `frontend/docs/3-physical-ai/chapter-6-real-world-applications-of-physical-ai.md`
- **Content**: Explores applications in manufacturing, healthcare, agriculture, service robotics, logistics, construction, and environmental monitoring.

### Chapter 7: The Role of Simulation in Physical AI
- **File**: `frontend/docs/3-physical-ai/chapter-7-the-role-of-simulation-in-physical-ai.md`
- **Content**: Discusses simulation benefits, physics-based simulation, domain randomization, sim-to-real transfer, advanced platforms, and limitations.

### Chapter 8: The Future of Physical AI: Towards General Intelligence
- **File**: `frontend/docs/3-physical-ai/chapter-8-the-future-of-physical-ai-towards-general-intelligence.md`
- **Content**: Explores pathways to AGI, embodied cognition, multi-modal learning, lifelong adaptation, collective intelligence, and ethical considerations.
