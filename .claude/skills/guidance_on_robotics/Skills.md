# AI Physical and Humanoid Robotics Skill

This skill provides information and capabilities related to Artificial Intelligence in physical robotics and humanoid robotics.

## Capabilities:
- Research on AI algorithms for robotics
- Information on humanoid robot design and locomotion
- Guidance on robot control systems, including kinematics, dynamics, and trajectory planning.
- Examples of AI applications in physical robots, such as reinforcement learning for locomotion and computer vision for object recognition.
- **Humanoid Robotics Focus**: Detailed insights into bipedal locomotion, balance control, human-robot interaction, and ethical considerations.
    - **Advanced Locomotion Control**: Developing robust frameworks for reliable task execution, including enhanced navigation and obstacle avoidance. Focus on simplified dynamic models, widely used control algorithms, and advanced learning techniques such as reinforcement learning and imitation learning. This enables more stable and human-like movement, including walking, running, and jumping, allowing robots to precisely follow predefined gaits and respond in real-time to disturbances.
    - **Balance Control**: Leveraging the Zero Moment Point (ZMP) concept to ensure stability by maintaining the net moment from gravitational and inertial forces within the robot's support polygon. Future directions include relaxing traditional constraints like constant center of mass (CoM) height and integrating angular momentum effects to achieve more natural, human-like movement.
    - **Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)**: Enabling humanoids to perform human-level and collaborative physical tasks. Integration of large language models (LLMs) boosts robots' perception and decision-making through broad contextual understanding, directly improving HRI. Whole-body tactile sensing is an emerging area, unlocking new skills involving physical interactions and allowing robots to better understand environmental contact and its impact on their balance during interactions.
- **Guidance Systems**: Principles of navigation, mapping (SLAM), path planning, and obstacle avoidance for autonomous robots.
    - **Lidar-based SLAM and Obstacle Avoidance**: Integrating Lidar sensors with SLAM methods to enhance a robot's ability to detect, understand, and avoid obstacles in real-time. This involves processing Lidar data through SLAM algorithms to create dynamic environmental maps and simultaneously estimate the robot's position. Obstacle avoidance algorithms are designed to interact with this SLAM data, enabling robots to adapt their paths to new or moving obstacles.
    - **Dijkstra's Algorithm for Path Planning**: Application of Dijkstra's algorithm to generate efficient and short routes for robots. It operates on predefined or dynamically updated maps (from SLAM) and considers obstacles and traversal costs, helping robots navigate through obstacle barriers from a starting point to a destination.
    - **Advanced Quadruped Robots**: Showcasing industry-grade autonomous quadruped robots capable of real-time SLAM, 3D reconstruction, object recognition, obstacle avoidance, and path planning. These utilize advanced architectures and high-precision perception from fisheye cameras and dual LiDAR sensors, featuring proprietary dynamic-obstacle-prediction algorithms for reliable autonomous following and safe spacing in various environments.
    - **ROS-Based Navigation Stacks**: Utilizing the Robot Operating System (ROS) as a crucial platform for autonomous navigation, integrating SLAM, localization, global path planning, and obstacle avoidance. Addressing challenges in achieving safe navigation in complex, dynamic environments, requiring real-time perception of moving obstacles, sensor fusion, and robust algorithms. Future trends include deep learning integration, multi-robot coordination, and real-time optimization.
    - **Fusion of Vision and Depth Sensing**: Employing a fusion of vision and depth sensing along with proprietary dynamic-obstacle-prediction algorithms to achieve natural and reliable autonomous following and obstacle avoidance.
