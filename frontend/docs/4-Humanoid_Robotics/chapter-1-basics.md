# Basics of Humanoid Robotics

This chapter delves into the fundamentals of humanoid robotics, covering their design, locomotion, and control systems.

## What are Humanoid Robots?

Humanoid robots are robots designed to resemble the human body, particularly with a torso, head, two arms, and two legs. Their design aims to allow them to interact with human-centric environments and tools more naturally.

## Design and Structure

Key aspects of humanoid robot design include:

- **Bipedal Locomotion**: The ability to walk on two legs, mimicking human gait.
- **Articulated Limbs**: Joints and links that provide degrees of freedom for movement.
- **Balance and Stability**: Complex control systems to maintain balance during movement and interaction.

## Control Systems

Controlling humanoid robots involves:

- **Kinematics and Dynamics**: Mathematical models describing the robot's motion and forces.
- **Sensory Feedback**: Using data from cameras, force sensors, and accelerometers for perception and control.
- **Motion Planning**: Algorithms to generate smooth and safe trajectories for movement.
