## Prompt
I have finished this task write all above work as spec in specs.md inside 002-book-frontend folder alreday exist

## Response
The agent created a new feature specification for "Frontend Enhancements" in `specs/003-frontend-enhancements/spec.md`.
A quality checklist was also generated and validated, available at `specs/003-frontend-enhancements/checklists/requirements.md`.
One item, "Edge cases are identified", was noted as needing further attention.
